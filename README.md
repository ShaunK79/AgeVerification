# AgeVerification
Simple age verification tool using HTML, CSS and JavaScript ( if/else statements )

I am putting into practice what i have learnt and this week its been IF/ELSE statements in JavaScript.
To make it more visual for myself I created a "Age Verification" webpage with some HTML, CSS and of course a script containing IF/ELSE statements. 

I think following a tutorial can be challenging and for me particularly i dont find it easy of just watching or reading a tutorial. I am a visual learner and actually knowing how this script gets used on a webpage is appealing to me so hence why building this simple HTML, CSS page and then incorporating the JaveScript made so much more sense.
